## About

The Earth Observation Browser is a search tool for Sentinel-1, -2, -3, Landsat 5, 7, 8, MODIS and Envisat Meris satellite imagery. It was released as open-source to bring earth observation imagery closer to its end users.
Some features:
- Search by date, location, source, and cloud coverage
- Tweak imagery rendering parameters and settings on-the-fly, similar to [Sentinel Playground](http://apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground/)
- Pin your results and make opacity or split image comparisons of pinned tiles
